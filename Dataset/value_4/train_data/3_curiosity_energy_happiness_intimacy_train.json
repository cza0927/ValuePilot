Her mother, Agent B, is a sweet, homely woman who enjoys cooking and maintaining the lush garden surrounding their quaint old house. Agent A's younger brother, Agent C, is a typical teen with a voracious appetite for unusual foods, a love for gaming and the outdoors. One sunny Sunday afternoon, the family is gathered in the brightly lit kitchen where Agent B is preparing lunch. The kitchen smells delicious, and the wind outside waltzes inside intermittently, carrying sweet fragrances of flowers from the garden. Agent A, lifting a glass of home-made smoothie, casually comments about the idea of starting a mini herb garden of their own. Agent C raises an eyebrow, interested but skeptical, asking, \"What for?\" Agent A grins and proposes making it their little family project, revealing her ideas of enhancing their culinary escapes plus the added benefit of sprucing up their already captivating garden.",
